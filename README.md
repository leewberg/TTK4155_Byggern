Some notes regarding ownership of this project. Though no longer represented as such in the .git file, the doom portion of this project is a fork of the nano-doom repo at https://github.com/daveruiz/doom-nano.
A lot of changes were necessary to get this to work on our solution including the entire CAN frame streaming protocol, that are included in this file, so i'm not going to exclude it entirely from this deliverable though
this also includes most of the code in the display file and similear files
As a final note to the plagarism reviewer, programing is inevatably a collaborative effort and it is unreasonable to expect a solution to be completely original, nor is making such a solution practical. That being said, all drivers/transfers/ect. required for the project are completely ours.
